# Swift-Projects
App created on Xcode using MapKit and SwiftUI

Hi Everyone! Thanks for looking at my project.
This app was created following a Youtube Tutorial by Swiftful Thinking. I'm not an expert and I took this challenge to learn something new and test myself.
Hovewer, I can assure you that this is not just a copy and paste. I was really engaged while writing code and I tried to understand as much as possible from this experience.
I hope you can learn something new from this project and maybe find some new inspiration.
Support me, I'm putting so much effort in learning Swift tough I'm just at the beginning of this fantastic trip.
